✅ Prompt:
"Create a 6-level sunburst chart to visualize hierarchical product sales data, starting from the total level and drilling down through year, gender, category, subcategory, and model."




Structure:
	5-level hierarchy:
	Year → Gender → Category → Subcategory → Model

	Center circle:

		White background

		Displays:
			39%
			Female
			$23.466.508,83 (formatted as European currency
			
			
			
✅ What needs to be fixed:
	Center box should be circular (not rectangular)

	Solution: use a transparent root node (via dummy root) so Plotly leaves a true circular hole in the middle.

	First visible data ring (e.g., Year) must start from the edge of the white center

	Solution: the hierarchy must start under a dummy root (e.g., "Total") — this shifts Year outward.



✅ Updated Plan:
		
Render a 6-level hierarchy: Total → Year → Gender → Category → Subcategory → Model

We’ll:

	Add a dummy root node ("Total")

	Group the entire dataset under "Total" in a new column

	Render a 6-level hierarchy: Total → Year → Gender → Category → Subcategory → Model

	Set root_color="white" so the middle is circular and white

	Overlay an annotation for the center text
